    <h1 align="center">The Tale of the Three Princes</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Once upon a time, in the great kingdom ruled by King
      Vikramaditya, there were three young princes named Anand, Karan, and Raj.
      These brothers were known throughout the land for their courage and
      intelligence. One day, they decided to go on a quest to prove themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;They embarked on a journey deep into the forest, guided by the
      tales of a hidden treasure. After days of traveling, they reached a dense
      forest, which was said to be the hiding place of the treasure. However,
      the forest was known to be haunted by various spirits and creatures.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;As the three princes ventured deeper into the forest, they
      came across a beautiful fairy who was trapped in a spider's web. Anand,
      the eldest brother, decided to rescue her. With his sword, he cut the web
      and set the fairy free. In gratitude, she gave him a magical ring that
      would grant him three wishes.

    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;The brothers continued their journey, and soon they
      encountered a hungry lion. Karan, the middle brother, approached the lion
      carefully and offered it some food from their provisions. The lion was
      grateful and decided to accompany them on their quest, protecting them
      from any danger.

      &emsp;&emsp;Finally, the brothers reached the heart of the forest, where
      they found a massive tree with a hollow trunk. Inside the trunk, they
      discovered the hidden treasure. They were overjoyed and decided to share
      it equally among themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Just as they were about to leave the forest with the treasure,
      Raj, the youngest brother, spotted a poor beggar who was hungry and
      shivering in the cold. Raj couldn't ignore the beggar's plight and gave
      him some food and warm clothing from their provisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;As they left the forest, they were confronted by Betal, who
      had been observing their actions. Betal was impressed by the brothers'
      kindness and generosity. He decided to reveal himself and said, "You have
      passed my test, O Princes! You have proven your courage, wisdom, and
      compassion. Now, I shall grant each of you a reward."
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;Anand used his first wish to build a grand palace for his
      kingdom. Karan wished for the lion to be transformed into a wise and loyal
      minister to serve their kingdom. Raj, the youngest, wished for the
      treasure to be used to help the poor and needy throughout the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;With their wishes granted, the three brothers returned to
      their kingdom as heroes. They ruled with wisdom and compassion, and their
      kingdom prospered in peace and harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &emsp;&emsp;And so, King Vikramaditya learned from this tale that courage,
      intelligence, and compassion are qualities that should be treasured above
      all else, and they lead to true success and happiness in life.
